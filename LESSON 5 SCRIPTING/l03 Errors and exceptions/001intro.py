"""
Syntax errors :
    occur when Python can’t interpret our code, since we didn’t follow the correct syntax for Python. 
    These are errors you’re likely to get when you make a typo, or you’re first starting to learn Python.

Exceptions :
    occur when unexpected things happen during execution of a program, 
    even if the code is syntactically correct. 
    There are different types of built-in exceptions in Python, 
    and you can see which exception is thrown in the error message.
