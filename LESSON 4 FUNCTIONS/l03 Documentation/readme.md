# Documentation 
is used to make your code easier to understand and use. Functions are especially readable because they often use documentation strings, or docstrings. 
# Docstrings 
are a type of comment used to explain the purpose of a function, and how it should be used. 
# Types of docstrings
- one line Docstring 
: if you find one line to suit explanation fot a function it's good
- Multilines Docstring 
if the functions are complex and need further explanation we can use this :
: - First line : Brief explanation
: - 2nd Part: Input arguments explanation 
: - 3rd Part: Output explanation
